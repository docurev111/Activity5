        title: 'Understanding Echo System',
        content: `The Echo system is one of the core mechanics in Wuthering Waves. Here's everything you need to know:

**What are Echoes?**
Echoes are abilities you can absorb from defeated enemies and equip to enhance your characters.

**Echo Rarity:**
- 2-star: Common echoes
- 3-star: Uncommon echoes
- 4-star: Rare echoes
- 5-star: Legendary echoes

**Tips for Echo Farming:**
1. Focus on main stats first
2. Sub-stats become important in late game
3. Match echo sets with character playstyle
4. Don't waste resources on low-rarity echoes early on

Master the Echo system to maximize your team's potential!`,
